# **Around**

![](../documentation/images/Gentlearound.png)

I wanted to build a social platform that lets you break through your closed social cliques and instead try to diversify and expand them with people and events around you. Let's say You’ve landed in a strange city? This is the action happening around you right now. Everything is foreign and you don't much about whats happening around you, but when you check around it shows you that there is a concert around you. You might like this because you’ve indicated a love of music. In the concert itself – it’s the girl or the guy dancing next to you. Maybe send them an animated GIF to break the ice? Humans as curious animals are naturally interested in the unknown. Around will help us expand our horizons and encourage us to explore new place in a post covid period.
